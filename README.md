# Stress-Constrained-TopOpt
MATLAB code for performing Stress Constrained Topology Optimization based on the 99 line Top-Opt Code for optimization of a MBB beam. The optimization method is the MMA (Method of Moving Asymptotes) by Svanberg. The function is included in the file. The material properties were taken from similiar works by Ole Sigmund.
P-norm method has been used for faster stress optimization.
